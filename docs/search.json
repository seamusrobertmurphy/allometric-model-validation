Compute Equations\nNote all four equations that follow derive estimates according to specific species, whether measured at the plot level, stratum or globally.

Volume estimates are derived in terms of m3/ha-1 using an expansion factor derived as the ratio of plot area 1,000m2 to 10,000m2, as follows.\n\ndataset_tidy = dataset_tidy |&gt;\n  group_by(stratum_i, species_j) |&gt;\n  mutate(vji_ha_m3 = mean(vji_sp_m3) * 10)\n\ndata.table::setDT(dataset_tidy)[, .(\n  vji_sp_m3,\n  vji_ha_m3\n  ),\n  by = .(stratum_i, species_j)\n] |&gt; kbl() |&gt; kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\nstratum_i\nspecies_j\nvji_sp_m3\nvji_ha_m3\n\n\n\n\n1\nSp1\n12.18\n121.8\n\n\n1\nSp1\n12.18\n121.8\n\n\n1\nSp1\n12.18\n121.8\n\n\n1\nSp4\n3.18\n31.8\n\n\n1\nSp4\n3.18\n31.8\n\n\n2\nSp1\n1.38\n13.8\n\n\n2\nSp2\n3.24\n32.4\n\n\n2\nSp3\n3.72\n37.2\n\n\n2\nSp4\n2.94\n29.4\n\n\n2\nSp5\n3.36\n33.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEQ3: Harvest carbon\nOn page 20 of the VM0010 Methodology, ‘equation 3’ provides calculation of carbon stock of harvested timber volumes for species i in stratum i.\nIn the absence of harvest plan data, carbon stocks of commercial timber will be derived from the full inventory dataset_tidy.\nThis differs to ‘equation 3’ below, which measures mean carbon stock from volumes of ‘harvested biomass’ \\(C_{HB,j,i|BSL}\\) comprised of volumes estimates from extracted timber that is destined off-site for market sales, in addition to volume estimates from extracted timber that is remaining on-site due to damage or use during site operations and road construction. The difference in destinations of these carbon stocks means that alternative carbon factors must be applied in their calculation, as indicated in following two equations\n\\[C_{HB,j,i|BSL} = (V_{EX,j,i|BSL} + V_{EX,INF,j,i|BSL} ) * BCEF_{R} * CF_{j}\\]\nCarbon estimates are calculated in units of metric tons per hectare (tC/ha-1) by multiplying mean volume per hectare of extracted timber of species i from stratum j by the carbon fraction \\(CF\\) (default = 0.5) and biomass conversion and expansion factor \\(BCEF_{R}\\) of that species. If needed, VM0010 methoodology provides guidance on approriate literature source for defining CF with prioritiy of local forest types over national and regional forest types, over forest types from neighboring countries. However, if defaulting to global forest type values, recommendations point to chapter four of (Krey et al., n.d.) that cite value of 1.11. We rely on the provided value of 0.7.\n\ndataset_tidy &lt;- dataset_tidy %&gt;%\n  mutate(chb_ha_tC = vji_ha_m3 * bcef_r * cf)\n\ndata.table::setDT(dataset_tidy)[, .(\n  vji_sp_m3,\n  vji_ha_m3,\n  chb_ha_tC\n  ),\n  by = .(stratum_i, species_j)\n] |&gt; kbl() |&gt; kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\nstratum_i\nspecies_j\nvji_sp_m3\nvji_ha_m3\nchb_ha_tC\n\n\n\n\n1\nSp1\n12.18\n121.8\n42.63\n\n\n1\nSp1\n12.18\n121.8\n42.63\n\n\n1\nSp1\n12.18\n121.8\n42.63\n\n\n1\nSp4\n3.18\n31.8\n11.13\n\n\n1\nSp4\n3.18\n31.8\n11.13\n\n\n2\nSp1\n1.38\n13.8\n4.83\n\n\n2\nSp2\n3.24\n32.4\n11.34\n\n\n2\nSp3\n3.72\n37.2\n13.02\n\n\n2\nSp4\n2.94\n29.4\n10.29\n\n\n2\nSp5\n3.36\n33.6\n11.76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEQ4: Extracted carbon\n“Not all of the harvested biomass leaves the forest because the timber harvested has two components: 1) wood removed to market (extracted timber) and 2) wood remaining in the forest as a result of harvest” (VM0010, 2024:21).\nTo account for all harvest removals, ‘equation 4’ computes mean carbon of species i in stratum j by adding mean timber to market (\\(V_{EX,j,i|BSL}\\)) and mean timber used in harvest infrastructure (\\(V_{EX,INF,j,i|BSL}\\)). This sum is then multiplied by the wood density \\(D\\) and carbon fraction \\(CF\\) of that species and reported in units of tC.ha-1 using the following formula:\n\\[C_{EX,j,i|BSL} = (V_{EX,j,i|BSL} + V_{EX,INF,j,i|BSL} ) * D_{j} * CF_{j}\\]\n\ndataset_tidy &lt;- dataset_tidy %&gt;%\n  mutate(cex_ha_tC = vji_ha_m3 * d * cf)\n\ndata.table::setDT(dataset_tidy)[, .(\n  vji_sp_m3,\n  vji_ha_m3,\n  chb_ha_tC,\n  cex_ha_tC\n  ),\n  by = .(stratum_i, species_j)\n] |&gt; kbl() |&gt; kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\nstratum_i\nspecies_j\nvji_sp_m3\nvji_ha_m3\nchb_ha_tC\ncex_ha_tC\n\n\n\n\n1\nSp1\n12.18\n121.8\n42.63\n30.45\n\n\n1\nSp1\n12.18\n121.8\n42.63\n30.45\n\n\n1\nSp1\n12.18\n121.8\n42.63\n30.45\n\n\n1\nSp4\n3.18\n31.8\n11.13\n7.95\n\n\n1\nSp4\n3.18\n31.8\n11.13\n7.95\n\n\n2\nSp1\n1.38\n13.8\n4.83\n3.45\n\n\n2\nSp2\n3.24\n32.4\n11.34\n8.10\n\n\n2\nSp3\n3.72\n37.2\n13.02\n9.30\n\n\n2\nSp4\n2.94\n29.4\n10.29\n7.35\n\n\n2\nSp5\n3.36\n33.6\n11.76\n8.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEQ5: Slash carbon\n\\[∆C_{DWSLASH_,i,p|BSL} = \\sum_{i=1}^{j} \\space [C_{HB,j,i|BSL} - C_{EX,j,i|BSL} + C_{RSD,j,i|BSL} + C_{notHB,inf,j,i|BSL}]\\]\nEquation 5 computes carbon change produced by slash as “the difference between the total carbon stock of the harvested biomass and the carbon stock of the extracted timber, plus the residual stand damage and biomass of trees left to decay as a result forestry infrastructure establishment”. Specifically, values of \\(C_{notHB,inf,j,i|BSL}\\) are computed by applying a fractional value of timber used in harvesting infrastructure development (\\(F_{V,INF,HWP}\\)), which may be provided by project proponent, and if missing will be conservatively assumed as 0.0%.\n\n\nEQ6: Damaged carbon\n\\(C_{RSD,j,i\\|BSL}\\) is defined in units of tC·ha-1 as mean carbon change from residual stand damage as computed in the following:\n\\[C_{RSD,j,i\\|BSL} = C_{EX,j,i|BSL} \\times F_{RSD|BSL}\\] where \\(F_{RSD|BSL}\\) represents a dimensionless value for the factor of “residual stand damage” per species in that area. On page 56 of the VM0010 document, an example reference is cited for sourcing residual stand damage values (Winjum, Brown, and Schlamadinger 1998).

Wood product classes may include sawnwood, panels, roundwood, paper, etc. In addition, the amount of carbon stored in wood products that would decay within three years after harvest are assumed to be emitted at the time of harvest\n\n\nEQ9: HWP carbon loss year-0\nEquation 9 calculates mean carbon immediately emmited from harvested volumes at the time of harvest, as follows:\n\\[\n∆C_{WP0,i|BSL} = \\sum  \\space (C_{EX,i,k|BSL} \\times WW_k + SLF_k)\n\\]\nwhere input variables \\(SLF_f\\) and \\(WW_k\\) are derived as the fraction of carbon immediately emitted from specific short-lived wood products, and the fraction of carbon immediately emitted from wood waste, respectively.\n\n\nEQ10: HWP carbon store\nAlternatively, equation 10 computes mean carbon not immediately emitted from harvest volumes at the time of harvest (year=0), as follows:\n\\[\nC_{WP,i|BSL} = \\sum \\space (C_{EX,i,k|BSL} - ∆C_{WP0,i|BSL})\n\\]\n\n\nEQ11: HWP carbon loss year-100\nEquation 11 computes carbon stored in wood products that are assumed to be retired between 3 - 100 years after harvest from stratum i in land parcel p (tC ha-1), where \\(OF_k\\) provides the fraction of biomass carbon for wood product type k that is assumed to be emitted to the atmosphere between 3 and 100 years of timber harvest. Winjum, Brown, and Schlamadinger (1998) gives annual oxidation fractions for each class of wood products split by forest region (boreal, temperate and tropical), which is estimated to provide the fraction of carbon that is oxidized between the 3rd and the 100th year after initial harvest, as follows:\n\\[\n∆C_{WP100,i,p|BSL} = \\sum \\space (C_{WP,i|BSL} \\times OF_k)\n\\]\nwhere \\(OF_k\\) is defined in VM0010 documentation as the fraction of biomass carbon per product type k that is emitted to atmosphere in 100 years following timber harvest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEQ12: Fuel emissions\nTotal fuel emissions are derived from all sources presented in Table 2 on page 12 of [VM0010](https://verra.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VM0010_IFM_LtPF_v1.4_Clean_10282024.pdf). Specific emissions variables are defined in subsequent equations:\n\\[C_{FUEL} = \\frac{E_{HARVEST} + E_{HAULING} + E_{TRANSPORT} + E_{PROCESSING}} {\\frac{44}{12}}\\]\n\n\nEQ13: Harvesting fuel emissions\n\\[\nE_{HARVEST} = FC_{HARVEST} \\times EF_{FUEL} \\times \\sum_{j,i,p} \\space V_{EX,j,i|BSL} \\times A_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(FC_{HARVEST}\\) derives volume of fuel consumed by harvest operators per m3 of extracted log (kL/m-3) and \\(EF_{FUEL}\\) represents a fuel emission factor (tCO2e kL-1). These input variables must be derived through the common practice pathway method. The following sources of information are permitted for this: • Data from other forest management companies in the region; or • Data from peer reviewed literature (or published by government agency)\n\n\nEQ14: Hauling fuel emissions\n\\[\nE_{HAULING} = FC_{HAULING} \\times EF_{FUEL} \\times V{EX,j,i|BSL} \\times A_i\n\\]\n\n\nEQ15: Transport fuel emissions\n\\[\nN_{TRUCKS-TRANSPORT} =

    "text": "Overview\nThe following workflow demonstrates statistical validation and calibration procedures for allometric biomass models that meet ART-TREES requirements for carbon registry emissions reporting. This was derived in response to gaps in model selection methodology, specifically aimed at avoiding Types 1-4 statistical errors and over-fitting. Carbon registries mandate implementation of robust model selection protocols that ensure spatial and species relevance while recommending the optimization of predictive accuracy through systematic bias correction and hyper parameter tuning.\nEleven candidate allometric equations were evaluated using required uncertainty metrics including: 1) 90% confidence interval estimation, goodness-of-fit statistics (R²-adj, RMSE, AIC), residual analysis, and distribution testing across four species (Betula pendula, Betula pubescens, Picea sitchensis, Sorbus aucuparia). The workflow also documents examples of Monte Carlo error propagation and model selection following CEOS/NASA protocols for RMSE minimization and coefficient of variation analysis.\nAmong the eleven regression models tested, eight achieved acceptable performance statistics for carbon project applications. Evaluation of RMSE performance identified optimal equations in models M3 for Betula pendula (RMSE: 2.38), M7 for B. pubescens (RMSE: 0.00), M9 for P. sitchensis (RMSE: 1.47), and M11 for S. aucuparia. Polynomial transformation testing revealed significant improvements in model fit while avoiding overfitting through systematic validation protocols. Essentially, Monte Carlo simulations confirmed systematic bias &lt;5% across species, meeting ART-TREES requirements for uncertainty deduction calculations.\nThis framework provides carbon project developers with statistically robust model selection and calibration procedures required for registry compliance, reducing estimation uncertainty and audit risk while ensuring biomass predictions meet statistical performance standards mandated by Verra, ART-TREES, and ACR protocols.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIPCC Directives: Quantifying uncertainty in biomass estimates is a core directive of the IPCC (Eggleston et al., 2006) and, following UNFCCC Decision 4/CP.15 (2010), applies mandatorily to all REDD+ mechanism implementations. This regulatory foundation establishes uncertainty assessment not as optional best practice, but as legally required compliance for all forest carbon projects under international climate agreements.\nFailing to integrate the whole chain of error when estimating per-hectare biomass from inventory data and allometric equations artificially reduces confidence interval width (Fortin & DeBlois, 2010). This principle directly addresses the systematic underestimation of uncertainty that occurs when:\n\nAllometric model selection uncertainty is ignored or inadequately assessed\nParameter estimation errors are not propagated through calculations\nMeasurement uncertainties are treated independently rather than systematically combined\nModel structural uncertainty is omitted from confidence interval calculations\n\nThe choice of allometric model represents a major component of total error and reaches maximum impact when all candidate models are treated as equally likely without systematic validation protocols.\nART-TREES Section 8 provides the operational framework for implementing IPCC/UNFCCC uncertainty mandates, requiring that emission reductions be adjusted based on estimated uncertainty to prevent systematic over-crediting that undermines international climate accounting integrity.\n\n\nAllometry Validation Requirements\nART-TREES Section 8 mandates that emission reductions be adjusted based on estimated uncertainty to minimize over-crediting risk. Key requirements include:\n\n90% Confidence Interval Estimation: Half-width expressed as percentage of estimated emissions\nMonte Carlo Error Propagation: Minimum 10,000 simulation iterations using Approach 2 methodology\nWhole-Chain Error Integration: Systematic combination of allometric, measurement, and sampling uncertainties\nSystematic Bias Minimization: Validation against independent destructive harvest datasets\nUncertainty Deduction Formula: As cited on page 46 of the TREES Standards V2.0, calculations of uncertainty deductions are derived using the following formula:\n\n\\[\nUNC_t = (GHG ER_t + GHG REMV_t) \\times UA_t \\text{.
